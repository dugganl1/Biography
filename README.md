# Reports
This repository contains the written reports for CS3012:

# 1. **Biography of an Influential Software Engineer**

I chose to write about **Guido Van Rossum**, the creator of Python. This was an interesting task as he doesn't have many public appearances and there aren't any other comprehensive biographies of him online. I compiled information from a number of sources (mainly videos of interviews and speeches). 

# 2. Report: Measuring a Software Engineer's Work 

This report explores the ways in which the software engineering process can be assessed in terms of measurable data. It will also provide an overview of the computational platforms available to perform this work, as well as some of the algorithmic approaches available. Finally, I'll describe some of the ethics concerns surrounding this kind of analytics.
